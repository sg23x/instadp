# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: "Roboto-Bold"
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Roboto-Bold.ttf

    - family: "RobotoCondensed-Regular"
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/RobotoCondensed-Regular.ttf

    - family: "Roboto-Medium"
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Roboto-Medium.ttf

    - family: "Poppins-SemiBold"
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf

    - family: "Candara"
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Candara.ttf

    - family: "Poppins-Medium"
      fonts:
